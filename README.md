Angular-NuGet
=============

AngularJS NuGet package creation.

By Scott Hanselman and John Papa

*Thanks to Scott for the automation*

A series of Angular NuGet packages, with the philosphy of '1 Package Per Module'. 

###Why? 

Because the AngularJS package (which is awesome) is a super package with everything. And sometimes you do not want everything.

## Packages

- AngularJS.Core (all packages below depend on this one)
- AngularJS.Cookies
- AngularJS.Animate
- AngularJS.Loader
- AngularJS.Resource
- AngularJS.Route
- AngularJS.Sanitize
- AngularJS.Touch
